# Puppeteer & Jest Testing Example

## About This Repo

This repo consists of a number of example files using Puppeteer by itself and Jest and Puppeteer together to demonstrate how it can be used for user simulation and automated end-to-end testing.

## Running These Test Files

After cloning the repo, install all the dependencies.
<br>```yarn install```

Then, you can run any of the scripts inside the `package.json` file to see Puppeteer or Jest-Puppeteer in action.
<br>e.g. `yarn automationDemo.js`, `test google.test.js`
